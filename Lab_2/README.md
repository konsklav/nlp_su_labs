# Notebook 2

This notebook explores text clasification using a .csv file. The notebook experiments with numpy and pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation, along side some numerical operations. Sci-kit learn libraries are used for most ML tasks (i.e. classification, cross validation, etc.), while Matplotlib is employed to visualize K-Fold cross-validation splits. Also, the Transformers library and PyTorch are used to implement and fine-tune a BERT model for text classification, leveraging BertTokenizer for preprocessing and BertForSequenceClassification for training.

### Disclaimer:
The .csv file is not included given that the notebook has been run on Google Colab and the specified file is being collected from a github link that has been commented out in the notebook.
